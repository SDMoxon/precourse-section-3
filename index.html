        <h1>Charles Darwin</h1>
        <h2> Overview </h2>
           <div class = "sectionText">
              <p> Charles Robert Darwin, (12 February 1809 to 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist, geologist and biologist, best known for his contributions to the science of evolution. He established that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors, and in a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding.</p>
              
              <p>Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species, overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of transmutation of species. By the 1870s, the scientific community and much of the general public had accepted evolution as a fact. However, many favoured competing explanations and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. In modified form, Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.</p>

              <p> Darwin's early interest in nature led him to neglect his medical education at the University of Edinburgh; instead, he helped to investigate marine invertebrates. Studies at the University of Cambridge (Christ's College) encouraged his passion for natural science. His five-year voyage on HMS Beagle established him as an eminent geologist whose observations and theories supported Charles Lyell's uniformitarian ideas, and publication of his journal of the voyage made him famous as a popular author.</p>

        <h2>Five-Year Voyage</h2>
        <div class = "sectionText">
          <p>The second voyage of HMS Beagle, from 27 December 1831 to 2 October 1836, was the second survey expedition of HMS Beagle, under captain Robert FitzRoy who had taken over command of the ship on its first voyage after the previous captain committed suicide. FitzRoy had already thought of the advantages of having an expert in geology on board, and sought a gentleman naturalist to accompany them as a supernumerary. The young graduate Charles Darwin had hoped to see the tropics before becoming a parson, and accepted the opportunity. He was greatly influenced by reading Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology during the voyage. By the end of the expedition, Darwin had already made his name as a geologist and fossil collector, and the publication of his journal which became known as The Voyage of the Beagle gave him wide renown as a writer.</p>

          <p>The Beagle sailed across the Atlantic Ocean, and then carried out detailed hydrographic surveys around the coasts of the southern part of South America, returning via Tahiti and Australia after having circumnavigated the Earth. While the expedition was originally planned to last two years, it lasted almost five.</p>

          <p>Darwin spent most of this time exploring on land: three years and three months on land, 18 months at sea. Early in the voyage he decided that he could write a book about geology, and he showed a gift for theorising. At Punta Alta he made a major find of gigantic fossils of extinct mammals, then known from only a very few specimens. He ably collected and made detailed observations of plants and animals, with results that shook his belief that species were fixed and provided the basis for ideas which came to him when back in England, and led to his theory of evolution by natural selection.</p>

        <h2>Neo-Darwinism</h2>
        <div class = "sectionText">
          <p>The neo-Darwin view of evolution incorporates modern understanding of population genetics, developmental biology, and paleontology, to which is being added knowledge of the molecular sequencing of DNA and the insights it provides concerning the phylogeny of life.</p> 

          <p> The major premises of the genetic (synthetic) theory of evolution are: evolution is the change of gene (allele) frequencies in the gene pool of a population over many generations; species (and their gene pools) are isolated from one another, and the gene pool of each species is held together by gene flow; an individual has only a portion of the pool, which came from two different parents, and the portions are different in each individual; the alleles the individual receives are subject to chromosomal or gene mutations and recombinations; natural selection will favor some individuals, who will then contribute a larger portion of their gene combinations to the gene pool of the next generation; changes of allele frequencies come about primarily by natural selection, but migration, gene flow, and chromosomal variations are contributing factors; isolation and restriction of gene flow between subpopulations and their parent populations are necessary for the genetic and phenotypic divergence of the subpopulations.</p>
